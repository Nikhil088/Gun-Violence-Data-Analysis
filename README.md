# Gun-Violence-Dataset-Analysis

This project analyzes the **Gun Violence** dataset from Kaggle, focusing on exploring the trends, distribution, and patterns of gun violence incidents across the United States. The goal is to provide a better understanding of the key factors contributing to gun violence, with a specific focus on visualizing trends over time and identifying high-risk regions.

## Project Overview

- **Dataset Source**: [Kaggle - Gun Violence Dataset by whisperingkahuna](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/whisperingkahuna/gunviolence1)
- **Analysis Tools**: Python, Pandas, Matplotlib, Seaborn, Folium
- **Focus Area**: Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) and Data Visualization

## Dataset Description

The dataset contains information about gun violence incidents, including:
**Date** of the incident
- **Location** (State, City)
- **Number of Fatalities and Injuries**
- **Other Incident Details** (e.g., type of incident, weapon used, etc.)

## Key Visualizations

The following visualizations have been created to help explore the data:

1. **Gun Violence Incidents Over Time**
   - A time series plot showing the number of gun violence incidents by month/year.
   
2. **Top States with the Most Incidents**
   - A bar chart displaying the top 10 states with the highest number of gun violence incidents.
   
3. **Distribution of Fatalities and Injuries**
   - A histogram showing the distribution of fatalities and injuries across all incidents.
   
4. **Geospatial Map of Gun Violence Incidents**
   - An interactive map plotting the locations of gun violence incidents across the U.S. using latitude and longitude data.

## Results

Through the visualizations, we gain insights such as:
- Temporal trends in gun violence incidents over the years.
- Geospatial patterns that highlight high-incidence areas.
- A deeper understanding of the distribution of fatalities and injuries across incidents.

## Conclusion

This analysis provides an initial look into the patterns of gun violence incidents in the U.S. by utilizing visual exploration techniques. Further analysis could involve predictive modeling, identifying factors contributing to high-incident regions, and providing actionable insights for policymakers and advocacy groups.
